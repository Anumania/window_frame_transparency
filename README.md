# window_frame_transparency
very much hacked together fork of YAL's window_frame_transparency that allows one color to be set transparent 

currently set to #999900, the worst color.

This was previously used for a game, but i rewrote it to better suit the game, this isnt the best way of doing it but it works and the window-frame utilities are very nice
